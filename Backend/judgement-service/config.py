Central settings for the Jurinex judgement-service search pipeline.

Every credential and tunable comes from the environment (.env) — nothing
secret is hardcoded here. The .env in this folder is shared with other
Jurinex services, so unknown keys are ignored and a few names have
service-specific overrides (e.g. JUDGEMENT_API_PORT beats API_PORT).

#                (only < 1.0 in flexible mode; strict requires all)
#   section    — the query's section numbers appear in the judgment's
